Hi Gaby,

I also hope you are doing well.

Please see the attached files for the lat/lng coordinates for the GSV
and Emily's images.

Chicago_GSV_panorama_locations.csv have the lat/lng coords for each
GSV panorama id, and Chicago_GSV_roadview_mapping.csv and
Chicago_GSV_sideview_mapping.csv have the mappings between stimulus
image and GSV panorama id.

Emily_1200_images have the lat/lng coords, but not all the images have
the coords.

Have a wonderful weekend!

Thanks,
Kyoung
